PIN MAPPING:
3 (SCLK) -> SCLK
5 (SDA) <-> SDA
7 (GPIO4)<- ALERT/BUSY
11 (GPIO17) -> !CONVST
9 (GND) -> AS

NOTES:
AS = 0 AD7998-1 ADDR = 010 0011 


ALERT/BUSY:
SET ON ALERT = ACTIVE WHEN OUT-OF-RANGE INDICATOR BEYOND DATAHIGH AND DATALOW
SET ON BUSY = ACTIVE WHEN CONVERSION IN PROGRESS

!CONVST:
USED FOR MODE 1 IN CONERSION

**Ran tests without the ALERT/BUSY interrupts**


WRITE:
GETTING READY FOR SUBSEQUENT READ:
WRITE THE ADDRESS OF THE REG TO THE ADDRESS POINTER...
    010 0011 .... 0000 P3.P2.P1.P0

EX. WRITE FOR READ CONVERSION
    WRITE
    010 0011 0000 0000

WRITING SINGLE-BYTE TO ALERT OR CYCLE:
WRITE THE ADDRESS OF THE REG TO THE ADDRESS POINTER....

    D7.D6.D5.D4.D3.D2.D1.D0

WRITING TWO-BYTE TO LIMIT, HYSTERESIS, OR CONFIG:
WRITE THE ADDRESS OF THE REG TO THE ADDRESS POINTER...
WRITE THE 1ST DATA BYTE...
WRTIE THE 2ND DATA BYTE...

READ:
READING DATA REQUIRES THAT THE WRITE FOR SUBSEQUENT READ HAS BEEN SETUP
READ 1 OR 2 BYTE DATA BASED ON THE REGISTER
